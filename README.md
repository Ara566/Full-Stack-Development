# Full-Stack-Development
Welcome to My Full-Stack-Development repositery.

In this repositery, You can view my journey of becoming a Full-Stack Developer.

Full stack development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and deploying a complete web application from start to finish. It involves working with various technologies and tools, including front-end web development, back-end web development, and database development.

#Front-End_Development
-->Front-end web developers take care of the website’s style and user interface. As we probably know, HTML is the structural skeleton of a webpage.

-->Cascading Style Sheets as the physique or the body of the skeleton.CSS enables front-end, web developers, to modify the shape of the physique, which, in terms of websites, is like pre-defining certain sections to make the website display a specific style. 

-->javaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.

#Node.js
-->Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

#mongodb
-->MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.
I used mongodb compass(gui) and shell and mongodb commandline tools, its easily explore and manipulate your database with Compass, the GUI for MongoDB. Intuitive and flexible, Compass provides detailed schema visualizations, real-time performance metrics, sophisticated querying abilities, and much more.
The MongoDB Database Tools are a collection of command-line utilities for working with a MongoDB deployment.
