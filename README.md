# Full-Stack-Development
Welcome to My Full-Stack-Development repositery.

In this repositery, You can view my journey of becoming a Full-Stack Developer.

Full stack development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and deploying a complete web application from start to finish. It involves working with various technologies and tools, including front-end web development, back-end web development, and database development.

#Front-End_Development
-->Front-end web developers take care of the websiteâ€™s style and user interface. As we probably know, HTML is the structural skeleton of a webpage.

-->Cascading Style Sheets as the physique or the body of the skeleton.CSS enables front-end, web developers, to modify the shape of the physique, which, in terms of websites, is like pre-defining certain sections to make the website display a specific style.
