# Full-Stack-Development
Welcome to My Full-Stack-Development repositery.

In this repositery, You can view my journey of becoming a Full-Stack Developer.

Full stack development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and deploying a complete web application from start to finish. It involves working with various technologies and tools, including front-end web development, back-end web development, and database development.

#Front-End_Development
-->Front-end web developers take care of the websiteâ€™s style and user interface. As we probably know, HTML is the structural skeleton of a webpage.

-->Cascading Style Sheets as the physique or the body of the skeleton.CSS enables front-end, web developers, to modify the shape of the physique, which, in terms of websites, is like pre-defining certain sections to make the website display a specific style. 

-->javaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.

#Node.js
-->Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
